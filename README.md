# gluon-df
Gluon transverse momenta distribution generator

This a repo containing Monte-Carlo Simulator for Gluon transverse momenta distributions in the saturation region.
Generators for additional related distributions spanning the theory of spin-glass structures, random breaking etc. are also provided.

Requirements: python and octave/ matlab
